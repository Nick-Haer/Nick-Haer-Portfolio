# Nick-Haer-Portfolio

My web development portfolio, feel free to take a look and see what I've been working on.
Designed to be simple as well as easy to navigate and read, this web app showcases some of the projects I'm proudest of. Take a look at a React Native mobile app, a fullstack MERN webscraper, an app that promises to help you find your favorite Dallas craft brewery, and several more!

## Overview

Focused on elegant design and visual storytelling rather than technical complexity, this app is intented to be a springboard to checking out my projects. I hope you enjoy them as much I have enjoyed creating them! Check out my portfolio here: https://nick-haer.github.io/Nick-Haer-Portfolio/
